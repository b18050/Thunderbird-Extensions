# Thunderbird-Extensions
This will contain some add-ons Extensions as a part of Thunderbird Extension hacking .
Thunderbird will change its add-on framework as Firefox did: WebExtensions. 


#Introduction
The Thunderbird email client is of one of the most widely-used open
source applications.  It has a neat design by which one can write
extensions using a well-defined API.  The extension mechanism has
changed recently, such that older extensions no longer work.

#Description
A legacy extension converted to the format used in the current
version of Thunderbird.  This requires only knowledge of
JavaScript, elementary JSON and HTML.

It will help you learn the design and implementation of Thunderbird.

#Steps:
1. Download and install the current Thunderbird v 68.*

2. Configure it to work with your email id(s).

3. Get familiar with installing an addon: Download XNote++ and install
it in Thunderbird.  Make sure that it works.  Enable/disable it.

4. Read how to develop an extension in
https://developer.thunderbird.net/add-ons/about-add-ons  The current
extension type is "MailExtension". Write a simple
"Hello World" extension.

#Testing
Testing can be done in following ways:
1.It should work as a Temporary add-on.
2.It can be installed using "Install add-on from file", and
subsequently removed using the Add-on Manager.

#Add-ons extensions :
1.Hello-world
2."Reply to All as Cc" v 1.5.4 (updated)
3."resetrec" v 1.4 (updated)

4."send-unsent-messages-without-attachments

However, WebExtensions does not provide such API so far.
So, we need to develop your own APIs by using WebExtensionExperiments.

I would thank Dr.Timothy A. Gonsalves to let me know about this all.
